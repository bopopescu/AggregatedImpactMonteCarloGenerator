Each dataset describes alife cycle inventory on a unit process level. The complete list of all dataset names,of all elementary flow names and of all regional codes is available via the Internet and on this CD-ROM.The functional unit of all these unit processes is either a product or a service(whereby the product may be as large as one complete power plant manufacturedfor producing electricity). All products and services are assigned to a particular category and one or more subcategories. Please note that PRé Consultants uses a different (sub)category structure than ecoinvent to make the data compatible with the SimaPro database structure and the category names already used in SimaPro.  Process datasets are identified unequivocally by the name, the location, the unit and a marker for infrastructure processes. Unit processes are further identified by a U, system processes (results) are identified by an S.The data collected and compiled in the ecoinvent database are not primarily suitedfor direct comparisons. Waste management datasets for instance shall not directlybe used for waste management policy assessments (landfilling versus incineration),transport service datasets shall not directly be used for transport systemscomparison and farming systems (integrated, extensive or organic production) shallnot directly and solely be compared based on ecoinvent data. In all cases the systemsfor comparison have to be thoroughly defined beforehand. Then it has to be checkedwhich adaptation to the average data investigated would be necessary to appropriatelydescribe these systems according to the goals of the study.For detailed information, please see the information supplied on the ecoinvent website,www.ecoinvent.ch. Licensed users can also find a lot of information on the ecoinvent CD.This CD contains PDF files of all ecoinvent reports, spreadsheets of all data and a series of additional tools. It is especially recommended to read the ecoinvent Code of Practice, parts of which have beencited in this system description. SUPPORTSpecial emphasis was put on a very detailed documentation of the ecoinvent datain final reports and in the datasets meta information. If – even after reading thesedocuments – questions remain, the authors responsible for the respective datasetsshould first be contacted via the email address provided in the dataset metainformation. TERMS OF USEThe ecoinvent terms of use state that  “the use of the ecoinvent data by preparingextracts, or for further use for commercial purposes is prohibited. The licenseeshall not reproduce, disseminate or publicly display the ecoinvent data as awhole or any substantial part thereof, as determined by their nature and quantity.Reproduction, dissemination or public display with regard to nature and quantityof insignificant portions of the ecoinvent data is prohibited, to the extent thiswould unreasonably affect the legitimate interests of the Licensor.”It means that ecoinvent LCI raw data and results and LCIA results (either directlydownloaded from the ecoinvent database or calculated with ecoinvent LCI resultsand the factors downloaded from the ecoinvent database) shall not be reproducedin other LCA case studies. Contribution analyses may include graphical representationof the share of ecoinvent processes on the total LCA results (e.g., the contributionof energy supply to the total burdens of manufacturing a mobile phone). Herebythe possibilities to recalculate the exact LCI and LCIA results of an ecoinvent datasetshall be prevented as much as possible.For the full terms of use, please see the ecoinvent website or CD. If you have any questions, please contact the ecoinvent helpdesk. Note that apart from the ecoinvent term of use, the normal SimaPro license conditions apply.	"Sub-systemsCut-off rulesEnergy modelThe database contains country-specific electricity mixes both for the domestic production as well as for the supply. The supply mix is a mix of domestic production and electricity imports. Allcountry specific mixes are based on the average production situation in 2000. For each production and supply mix, four different datasets exist: at the busbar, athigh voltage, at medium voltage and at low voltage. The transport, transformationand distribution infrastructure is included accordingly.For LCA case studies we recommend to use the supply mixes at the appropriate voltagelevel (medium voltage for most industries, low voltage for households, commercialsand agriculture) and the appropriate location. The name of the production mixes contains “production country” in its name (e.g.,“electricity, medium voltage, production GB, at grid/GB/kWh/0”) and should normallynot be used in LCA studies. The only exception are production mixes forEuropean power associations (e.g. UCTE, CENTREL, NORDEL).Company-specific electricity mixes may be compiled using the datasets of individualpower plant technologies plus the datasets for transmission and distribution infrastructure.Grid losses and other operational emissions that occur during transmissionand distribution need to be added. Information is available in report No.6-XVI.4Demand for energy carriersEnergy carriers like petrol, natural gas or wood might be necessary for modelling asystem. The energy carrier’s fuel chain includes its transportation and distributionto the consumers (industrial, commercial, and agricultural consumers as well as households),but not the combustion of the fuel. The following datasets should be chosenin LCA studies:Oil products: the dataset names end with “ …, at regional storage”. These datasetsinclude storage and distribution (to the consumer) after refining crude oil. Fuels’datasets also include operation of filling stations. Hence, no additional transportservices need to be added. Datasets are offered for a Swiss (CH) and a European(RER) supply situation.Natural gas: Natural gas is supplied via low and high pressure networks. While lowpressure natural gas is mainly consumed by households, commercials and farms, highpressure natural gas is purchased by industrial clients. One dataset for low pressurenatural gas (CH) and several high pressure natural gas datasets (for Ireland, GreatBritain and those UCTE, CENTREL, and NORDEL countries operating natural gaspower plants) are available. The dataset name is “natural gas, high (low) pressure,at consumer”.Hard coal and lignite: While lignite is primarily used in mine-mouth power plantsand hardly treated nor transported, hard coal may undergo refinement and longdistancetransportation. Datasets are available for hard coal extracted in differentregions of the world, both at mine and at regional storage. Additionally, average supplymixes for all UCTE countries operating hard coal power plants are provided, includingtransport of coal from the regions of extraction to the individual countries andrepresenting country-specific import shares.Wood fuels: Two wood qualities and three wood products are distinguished, namelyhardwood and softwood on the one hand and pellets, logs and wood chips on theother. An additional distinction is made within wood chips, according to their provenance,i.e., directly from the forest and from industry. Furthermore, datasets for a mixof hard- and softwood (each for logs and wood chips, representing commercial conditionsof the Swiss market) and for charcoal are available.Fuel combustion and heat supplyDatasets are offered both for final and useful energy supply. If the amount of,e.g., light fuel oil burned in a boiler is known and no emission data are available,the final energy datasets are appropriate.They are all named similarly, starting with the name of the energy carrier (e.g.,“light fuel oil, burned in furnace ...”, “natural gas, burned in boiler ...”, or“logs, mixed, burned in furnace ...”).If the amount of useful heat required is known, then the datasets describing usefulheat supply are appropriate. Their name starts with “heat, ...” followed by theenergy carrier's name (e.g., “heat, hard coal coke, at ...”, “heat, natural gas, atboiler ...”, or “heat, heavy fuel oil, at ...”). Information support for the choice ofan appropriate dataset of useful heat supply is given in the respective reports.If the amount of energy carrier is known and the emissions due to energy supply arereported as well (in a company's environmental report, for instance), it is advisedto use the energy carrier's datasets  and the measured emissions.Additional pollutants, usually emitted by boilers but not measured and/or not reportedin the respective reference may be added based on information available fromthe ecoinvent database and the respective reports.For combined heat and power systems five distinct datasets are offered that arebased on different allocation parameters (energy, exergy, price, motivation heat andmotivation electricity). Within the ecoinvent database the heat and electricitydatasets based on exergy allocation are used as a default. Depending on the goalof an LCA, it may be appropriate to choose another allocation parameter or anotherallocation approach.Transport model"Transports of goods and persons are quite often necessary to link different stages ofa product life cycle. Datasets for transport services are developed to the extent towhich they are required within ecoinvent data. It includes average life cycle inventorydata for lorry, railway, ship and airplane transport services (based on averageload factors). Data provided are not suited to be directly used for the comparison ofdifferent transport systems or for the optimisation of a company’s logistic.The name of the datasets relevant for use in LCA studies describes the transport servicein ton kilometres and starts with “transport, …”. If the load factors of lorry transport differs substantially from the values used in ecoinvent, data of the operation of a lorry at full load and empty are available. But then, datasets on vehicleand traffic infrastructure, etc. need to be added to complete the model. Information support is given in the final report No. 14.If the amount of fuel used for transportation is given but not the total distance orthe total transport services required (in the environmental report of a company,for instance), the values presented in Tab. 5.1 in the code of conduct can be used to recalculate thetransport distance.Care has to be taken not to count lorry emissions twice. That is why it has to bechecked whether emissions reported in the same environmental report do includetransport-related emissions or not.Tab. 5.1 Fuel uses for passenger cars, delivery vans and lorries with 16t, 28t and 32t total weightVehicle 		Fuel		Unit 	CH	 		RER					MJ     g 	  l 		MJ      g        lCar 		gasoline 		vkm 	2.8    66    0.09 		2.8     66      0.09delivery van 	diesel / gasoline 	tkm 	11.2  260  0.32 		10.3   241    0.29Lorry 16t 	diesel 		tkm 	3.2    75    0.09 		3.4     79      0.09Lorry 28t or 32t 	diesel 		tkm 	1.5    36    0.04 		1.6     38      0.05Lower heating value: 42.5MJ/kg gasoline; 42.8MJ/kg dieselDensity of fuel: 0.75kg/l gasoline; 0.84kg/l diesel"Waste modelIn a life cycle from cradle to grave production or post consumer waste is an essentialpart. Waste treatment processes are modelled like any other technical process.Waste characteristics like elementary composition, heating value, waste burnabilityand waste degradation rates are used to calculate waste-specific outputs and expendituresof waste treatment processes. The model components developed and used in the ecoinvent project are describedin report No. 13.I.In contrast to former ETH waste data, the transport of the waste from the waste producerto the disposal facility is not included in the waste treatment datasets.Exceptions are the “disposal, building,...” datasets, where everything downstreamof demolition is included, and wastewater which is transported in sewers. For allother wastes a transport to the disposal facility must be inventoried additionallyby the user. See chapter “standard transportation distances” in the methodologyreport.The name of the waste treatment datasets starts with “disposal, …”, for incineration,landfills, building demolition, underground deposition and landfarming, andwith “treatment, …” for waste water treatment.Excel-tools for waste incineration, for different landfill categories, for landfarming,and for wastewater treatment are available on the CD-ROM. With the models, the user can calculate waste disposal inventories (unit process raw data) of specific wastes in theEcoSpold format, if case-specific waste compositions are available. It is also possibleto use the 260 precalculated datasets available in the ecoinvent database, if awaste is already adequately represented.The Excel-tools and its derived datasets describe the current state of technologyin operation in Switzerland. The state of technology (e.g., share of DeNOx-equipmentin municipal waste incineration plants) can however be changed accordingto a particular situation.Other assumptionsOther informationERRORSIf you think you have discovered an error in a dataset which has not been announcedso far via the ecoinvent website, please get in contact with the analyst responsiblefor the dataset. Please describe the error as detailed as possible in order to helpcorrecting it efficiently and in short time. Discovered errors are described onwww.ecoinvent.ch under the “Database News” (“Datenbank Neuigkeiten”) section.In case of serious errors an announcement will be sent out via the ecoinvent Newsletter.You can opt for receiving this Newsletter during the registration procedure on the ecoinvent website.QUOTATIONSThe ecoinvent data shall generally be quoted by including the exact version numberof the data, and whether data including or excluding infrastructure are used.Additional reference may be made to the respective final report(s) if data of selectedprocesses have been used (see Section 6.4 for quoting adapted versions of ecoinventdata).
